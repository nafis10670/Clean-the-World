# Clean-the-World

<p1>An infinite runner game made in Unity. The objective of the game is to collect two different types of trash that are littering the streets. Recyclable trash can only go
into recyclable bins and non-recyclable trash can only go into non-recyclable bins. The longer you collect trash the higher your score gets.</p1>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p1>Drag and drop the trash into their appropriate bins to remove them. If you collide with a trash, the game will be over. Your points will keep increasing as long as you can
survive. But be careful, the player's speed will continue to increase too with time.</p1>
